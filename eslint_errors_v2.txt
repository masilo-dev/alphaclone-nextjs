  125:38  error  Error: Cannot call impure function during render

`Date.now` is an impure function. Calling an impure function can produce unstable results that update unpredictably when the component happens to re-render. (https://react.dev/reference/rules/components-and-hooks-must-be-pure#components-and-hooks-must-be-idempotent).

`Date.now` is an impure function. Calling an impure function can produce unstable results that update unpredictably when the component happens to re-render. (https://react.dev/reference/rules/components-and-hooks-must-be-pure#components-and-hooks-must-be-idempotent).
